# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Predictor 🍴

Welcome to the **Restaurant Rating Predictor** project! This web app lets you predict the rating of a restaurant based on different features like cuisines, price range, and more. It's built using Flask, a trained machine learning model, and some spicy front-end flair! 🌶️

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. Enter details about the restaurant (like its city, cuisines, average cost, etc.) in the form on the homepage.
2. Hit the **Predict** button.
3. Our model will analyze the inputs and predict the restaurant's rating. 🎯

## 🧑‍🍳 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/restaurant-rating-predictor.git
cd restaurant-rating-predictor
```

### 2. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **IMPORTANT**: Upload the trained model
The model file `restaurant_rating_predictor.pkl` is too big to be included here (GitHub wasn’t too happy about the size 😅). So, make sure to upload your **trained model** to the root folder. If you don’t have one yet, no worries! Train a model using your own dataset and save it like so:

```python
import joblib

# Assuming 'model' is your trained ML model
joblib.dump(model, 'restaurant_rating_predictor.pkl')
```

### 4. Run the app:
```bash
python app.py
```

### 5. Visit your local server:
Fire up your browser and head to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
